# Music Releases
### Week 5 Technigo Bootcamp
This weeks project was done by both Jennifer Feenstra-Arengård and Eva Sjöholm. We used React and an API from Spotify to create a page with new albums and singles releases. 

## The problem
The goals for this week were to understand role of node & npm for running JavaScript scripts, learn how to write JSX and React components and learn how to use `.map` to iterate over an array of data. <br>
Using pair programming we first attempted to use react components to display album images and artists names which can be clicked to bring the user into respective spotify page. In addition we used css to style the page and make it responsive. 

 If we had more time we could make the icons responsive/clickable.
